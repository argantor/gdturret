# gdturret

`gdturret` is a single deployment of online torrent downloader which will sync downloaded files to google drive. Ultimate plan is to run my `gdturret` service on GCP or elsewhere to replace my Synology DS213+.

## Requirement
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive). Since `drive` is written in golang, you may require [platform specific installation methods](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive/blob/master/platform_packages.md)

## Usage
- Meet the requirement above.
- `./run.sh`
